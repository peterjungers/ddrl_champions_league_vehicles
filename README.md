# DDRL Champions League vehicle database
A searchable database for vehicles in the Damon Die-Cast Racing League (DDRL) who have qualified for the Champions League across the first nine seasons of the league.

This was my first independently made Python project (i.e., my first project not made for a class I was taking in school). It was made in June of 2022.
